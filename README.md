CircumSpectrum is a flux-based framework that converts bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data into metabolic fingerprints using genome-scale models and machine learning. It includes RADAR, SOURIS, and CORALIE modules for reaction-level, cross-cohort, and multi-tier correlation analyses.

The framework provides the following modules and datasets, with both TUI and GUI executables so you can start at any stage of the pipeline.
